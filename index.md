### Python Data Analysis Tutorials

I have a passion for learning and teaching Python for Data Science in an open source and reporoducible way. Below are two projects that demonstrate how to work with Python and utilize datasets on NYC Open Data. Note: "Data Analysis Using Python" has +240 GitHub stars and has been popular in the NYC Open Data community.
